    The Elevator Pitch
    <small>For the lazy and impatient.</small>
  </h1>
  <p>
  <code>ngbp-slim-sass</code> is a fork of <a href="">ngBoilerplate</a> 
    the opinionated kickstarter for web development projects. It's an 
    attempt to create a slimed down simple starter for new web sites and
    apps: just download it and start coding. The goal is to provide just 
    what you need you need to get started, and leave room for you to add
    the frameworks and libraries that you want use. It has a best practice 
    directory structure to ensure maximum code reuse. And it's all tied
    together with a robust build system chock-full of some time-saving 
    goodness.
  </p>

  <h2>Why?</h2>

  <p>
    Because I make web apps, and I like to try out different frameworks and
    combinations of libraries.  With AngularJS rocking the front-end development
    world I wanted to create a generic boilerplate that could tie in AngularJS
    with every framework that I wanted to try. 
    <code>ngbp-slim-sass</code> attempts to reach that goal.  
    
    Maybe you want to use <a href="https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass">Bootstrap</a>
    for your next project...<a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/">go ahead!</a> 
    Want to give the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation">Foundation Framework</a>
    a go...<a href="https://github.com/madmimi/angular-foundation">why not</a>? 
    Maybe <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy Grids</a> are your cup of tea...
    drink up!
  </p>

  <p>
    The original <a href="">ngBoilerplate</a> is an awesome kickstarter for your
    project, but I found myself repeatedly removing components I didn't want, and
    switching my projects from LESS to SASS, so I decided it was high time I went
    ahead and created my own fork.

    So What's Included?
    <small>Just the minimum</small>
  </h1>

  <p>
    This slim down version of <a href="https://github.com/ngbp/ngbp">ngBoilerplate</a> makes 
    use of the <a href="http://sass-lang.com">SASS</a> CSS preprocessor for all of your awesome 
    styling needs. The <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>,
    collection of font-based icons is hanging around to fill that icon shaped hole in 
    your heart.  Most important of all: the almighty power of <a href="http://angularjs.org">
    AngularJS</a> is running this show with its super neato client side superpowered core.
